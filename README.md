# machine-learning-engine-test
Python project for binary classification of engine test results (Pass/Fail) using a perceptron-style manual gradient update algorithm, with custom data visualization and no ML libraries used. Perfect for educational demonstration and engineering analysis.

Engine Pass/Fail Classification using Python

This project showcases a perceptron-inspired binary classifier built from scratch in Python to predict engine test outcomes (Pass/Fail).
Key steps include dataset import, feature matrix creation, custom gradient updates for classification, and Matplotlib-based visualization of decision boundaries and test results.
No external machine learning libraries are usedâ€”making this ideal for academic demonstrations and engineering analysis.
Features:

Simple, transparent perceptron logic

Fully inspectable update rules

Clear, step-by-step visualization of classifier performance
